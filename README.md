# Constructor Word Guess Game

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) word guess game.

## How it works
The game randomly selects a fruit from a list, the player guesses a letter, if correct it will replace the underscore
with the correct letter. The player wins when they have guessed all the letters. At that time the player will be asked
if they would like to play again.
